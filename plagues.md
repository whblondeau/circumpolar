##Plagues of the 21st Century

The decline of industrial civilization was primarily driven by resource depletion, heartily assisted by climate change. These were foreseen; were gradually recognized as being inevitable; and were in general endured rather than prepared for. However, the role played by pandemic disease was less clearly anticipated, and not easily predictable.

The primary historical lessons of the great pandemics of the 21st century were:

 - In a stressed and declining industrial civilization, plagues can exhibit accelerated virulence due to a population out of proportion to its medical and public-health resources.

 - In a stressed and declining industrial civilization, plagues often end up killing more people through economic destruction than through direct disease fatality. In this case, more people starve to death or are destroyed in widespread outbreaks of panicked civil disobedience triggered by fear of the plague, than by the plague itself.

The plagues of the 21st century did, however, have a beneficial effect. By killing humans that could not otherwise have been so quickly reduced; and ruthlessly, quickly destroying economies whose reflex activity could have been expected to continue emitting greenhouse gases, radioactive wastes, and biotoxins, the Plagues blunted much of the ecological damage that could otherwise have been expected to occur. In fact, analysis indicates that the short duration and comparative mildness of the global warming spike can be in large part attributed to the Plagues that took down industrial civilization more quickly than might otherwise have been expected.
